# My take at DataTalksClub LLM Zoomcamp 👨🏻‍🎓

I enrolled for the 2025 cohort of [LLM Zoomcamp: A Free Course on Real-Life Applications of LLMs](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp), hope I can finished the course and submit a project 🦾!

The Markdown text in the notebooks are chunks from the notebooks in the **LLM Zoomcamp repo** all credits go to them.(I copied the text to have an idea of what the code in that area refers to) so I strongly advise you to use the notebooks in their [repo](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp).

## Roadmap

## Timeline

### 2025-06

##### June 15th

- The journey starts!
- Completed the content in module 01-Intro

##### June 16th

- Submit Homework Module 01 - Introduction

### 2025-06

##### June 22nd

- Start working on _Module 02 - Vector Search_ (I watched the first 3 videos the days before)
  - Getting my feet wet with Vector Search and Qdrant
  - Choosing the embedding model, creating a collection, embedding text data and inserting points into the collection
  - Looking at the data using a cluster algorithm in 2D representation
  - Runned Similarity Search, also applying filters to the search.

##### June 23rd

- Substitute minsearch function for vector search function that uses Qdrant

##### June 27th

- Worked on Hybrid Search notebook, took a look at Sparse Vectors and the BM25 algorithm, used Qdrant prefetching to retrieve candidates with a dense vector search, and then rerank them with sparse search.
- Build Hybrid Search approach with Qdrant by using Reciprocal Rank Fusion to combine results from dense vectors with sparse ones.
- Completed the content in module 02-vector-search
- Submitted Homework Module 02 - Vector Search

### 2025-07

#### July 28th

- Submitted Homework for module 03 - Evaluation
