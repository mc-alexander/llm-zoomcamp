# My take at DataTalksClub LLM Zoomcamp 👨🏻‍🎓:honduras:

I enrolled for the 2025 cohort of [LLM Zoomcamp: A Free Course on Real-Life Applications of LLMs](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp), hope I can finished the course and submit a project 🦾!

The Markdown text in the notebooks are chunks from the notebooks in the **LLM Zoomcamp repo** all credits go to them.(I copied the text to have an idea of what the code in that area refers to) so I strongly advise you to use the notebooks in their [repo](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp).
